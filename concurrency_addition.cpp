/* Write a program to calculate the sum of first 100 numbers efficiently by using concurrency. create 10 threads
 * calculating it synchronously , each of the thread calculates the sum of 10 numbers. once a thread finishes the task,
 * add the result calculated by that thread to the total sum and output the result with its thread label (nth thread etc)
 * then join the main thread. all threads should be joined to the main thread after calculation is done. after that,
 * output the total sum.
 *
 * Fail to achieve Thread Synchronization will result in critical resources access conflict.
 * in that case, the program will give you random result in every execution. because shared resources
 * are modified by multiple thread at same time.
 *
 * Note that you need to compile this program with " g++ -std=c++11 -pthread file_name.cpp -o output_name "
 *
 * example input
 * NONE
 * exmaple output
 *
 * Result: 55 By thread No. 1
 * Result: 155 By thread No. 2
 * Result: 255 By thread No. 3
 * Result: 355 By thread No. 4
 * Result: 455 By thread No. 5
 * Result: 555 By thread No. 6
 * Result: 655 By thread No. 7
 * Result: 755 By thread No. 8
 * Result: 855 By thread No. 9
 * Result: 955 By thread No. 10
 * the total sum is 5050
